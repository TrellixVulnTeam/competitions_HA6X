# Origin
The original `shortaudio_to_npy.py`, `utils.py` took too long to accomplish, let alone saying debugging or testing.
Therefore, I have written the `fake_shortaudio_to_npy.py`, `fake_utils.py` to simulate the process. I took about
more than ten minutes on a modern (2018), decent laptop.

There are at least two directions to accelerate that I would like to try:

01. Threading
02. Asyncio
